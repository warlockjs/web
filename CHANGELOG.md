# Changelog

All notable changes to `@warlock.js/web` are documented here.

## 4.16.0

**First published release.** The package existed in the monorepo but was absent
from the release registry, so it had never reached npm.

### Added

- SSR React pages served by the Warlock HTTP server. A page route is an ordinary
  Warlock route whose handler renders React instead of returning JSON.
- Hydration, and client-side navigation via `<Link>` — no document reload, Back
  and Forward included.
- React Fast Refresh in `warlock dev`, including a server render that reflects
  the edit rather than the pre-edit module.
- Typed links: `href(name, params, query)`; an unknown route name is a compile
  error.
- `revalidate()` — re-run the current route's loaders after a mutation.
- MRR's navigation API mirrored by name (`navigateTo`, `navigateBack`,
  `currentRoute`, `queryString`, …) without depending on that package.
- `warlock add web` scaffolds `src/web/` and registers the connector.

### Fixed

- `metadata()` no longer runs when a loader rejected. It used to be called with
  `data: undefined` while the type promised otherwise, so a metadata function
  reading its data threw a `TypeError` that **replaced the loader's real error**
  and pointed at the wrong file.
- Validation reads the same query the loader reads. Stage 4 took `query` and
  `params` from a hand-parsed URL while `body` and `headers` came from the
  request — so `?tags=a&tags=b` reached validation as `"b"`, and a rule on
  `filter.status` never fired because validation saw a key literally named
  `filter[status]`.
- `href()` emits the query grammar core actually parses; nested objects and
  arrays are no longer destroyed by `String(value)`.
